# Kubernetes Microservices Observability - JVM, SQL, Metrics, Logs & AI Dashboards 

This repository serves as a long-term base and implementation playground for building production-grade observability for microservices deployed on Kubernetes. It integrates multiple observability domains:
- JVM runtime diagnostics
- SQL performance monitoring
- Metrics ingestion and long-term storage 
- Logs processing and correlation 
- Distributed tracing 
- AI-driven anomaly detection and intelligent diagnosis 

The goal of this project is to create a multi-domain observability framework, including collector modules, Grafana dashboards, dataset pipelines, and a machine-learning based diagnostic layer. 

Please refer to the individual documents inside `docs/` for detailed design, architecture, and implementation.
