# JVM Layer Observability for Microservices on Kubernentes 
## Overview 
This repository focuses on building JVM-layer observability for production-grade microservices deployed on Kubernetes. Unlike general Kubernetes cluster monitoring, the emphasis here is on the JVM metrics of microservices themselves across different operational stages: 
- Runtime / Integration Testing / Load Testing phases 
- JVM-level metrics: memory usage, GC behavior, threads, CPU, and other key performance indicators. 
- Metric computation & Grafana dashboards to visualize trends and fluctuations at different stages. 

The goal is to observe, understand, and anlyze JVM behavior of microservices under real-world conditions and workloads. 


## Project Scope 
### JVM Metrics Collection 

### Stage-Specific Observability 

### Grafana Dashboards 

## Goals 
- Build a hands-on, production-aligned observability framework for JVM-based microservices on Kubernetes. 
- Analyze JVM metrics behavior under different operational stages
- Generate reusable Grafana dashboards and metric computation patterns
- Serve as a learning and reference hub for microservice JVM monitoring and SRE observability best practices
